####### Generalized script to asses isotope ratios of ions of interest from Orbi measurements #############

# script shows an example of how the IsoOrbiStats functions may be applied

# This example folder contains files which have been obtained form Orbitrap measurements conducted in John Eilers lab at Caltech in 2019
# Briefly Phytane was introduced to the GC via direct elution mode (as described in Eiler et al., 2017) to determine the elution time for our phytane peak of interest
# Subsequently, Phytane was injected again, but this time in "peak trapping" mode. Phytane was captured in a reservoir inside the GC oven as it eluded of the column.
# Phytane was then allowed to exit the reservior end elude into the Orbitrap MS where a 10amu Mass window around mass 85.5 amu was measured for a duration of 70min in order to capture all Phytane molecules eluding from the reservoir.

# raw files are provided in the RAW folder. The raw files have been extracted and combined via the application IsoX (contact Cajetan Neubauer for access).
# the .isox file as well as the .tsv file used by IsoX to extract the RAW files are used for this script and provided inside the Example 1 folder

#------------

# Input
df= read.table("combined.isox", header=TRUE)
#supply a table (read.csv...header=TRUE) with column names: filename, start.min, end.min
ranges= read.csv("peak_times.csv", header=TRUE)
# mass tolerance for mass assignment in daltons
tolerance= 0.001
#exact masses. use same file as IsoX
masses= read.table("isotopologs.tsv", header=F)
#supply list of ions of interest
ions= c("C6H13") # works with multiple fragments yay!!!!
#supply list of isotopologs of interest (ONLY WORKS WITH 2!!)
ilogs=c("0","1")
#supply number of relevant atoms in ions of interest (order matters!)
n.atoms=c(6)

#load required packages
packages = c("plyr","dplyr","ggplot2","ggpubr","slider","psych","tidyverse","scales","cowplot","tidyquant","gtable","ggExtra","ggstance","gridExtra","grid","lubridate","datasets","gapminder","ggsignif","reshape2", "viridis")
# Now load or install&load all
package.check <- lapply(packages,
                        FUN = function(x) {
                          if (!require(x, character.only = TRUE)) {
                            install.packages(x, dependencies = TRUE)
                            library(x, character.only = TRUE)

#filter for mass tolerance, fragments/ions of interest within defined peak time and only including scans with both all isotopologs

f_df = filter.Idata(I_df, tolerance)
#calculate isotope-ratio values and restructure data frame; ions.incremental is not = Eiler 2017 NIO calculation!!!

#used to evaluate differnt culling options
#culled using ticxit
c_df = cull.Idata(r_df,Nio_ratio,Nio_ratio,300) # here I use Nio_ratio (only relevant when looking at summary data.frame), Nio_w_ratio or NL_ratio also works

#check summary file

#grab whatever culled dataframe you like best based on evaluations using chek_up, a_df and s_df data.frames
final_df = c_df[["3sd"]] # here i exclude all datapoints larger then 3x std dev of mean Nio_ratio

#calculate average isotope ratios of fragments/ions of interest. I.e. isotope ratio divided by the number of relevant atoms in fragment/ion of interest
final_df = avrg.ratios(final_df,ions,n.atoms)
#summary data for different NL ratio calculation options per compound also drops NA rows for background subtracted ratios
