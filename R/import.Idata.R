#'function that allows to import data set extracted from raw input using isoX. Use combined.isox file for multiple acquisitions
#'
#' @param df =data frame of isox data table output
#' @param ranges = data frame of .txt file with start and end times for the peak of interest in each measurement run
#' @param masses = dataframe of isotopologs.tsv file which was also used to generate the .isox file
#' @param ions = vector which contains all fragments/ions of interest
#' @param ilogs = vector of isotopologs of interest (has to be contained in isotopologs.tsv file)
#' @return = dataframe only containing columns for further analysis i.e. time ranges for each acquisition, filter for fragments/ions of interest and isotopologs of interest and mass defect value.
